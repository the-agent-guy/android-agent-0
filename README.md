# android-agent-0

A Generalist Android Agent.

The goal is to build an Agent that can do 100% of what a human can on a phone. The Agent should be purely vision-based, and specify actions directly using screen coordinates.

A naive GPT-4o agent has been implemented in `gpt4o_agent.py`. We will first maximize performance using GPT-4o using search algorithms like MCTS, and then move on to open source models and fine-tuning.
